Prototyping Wearable Devices With Javascript
==============

This will be your base project for the class.  During the session examples will be pushed up to this repo and shared with you in branches as we move through our examples.

##Getting Set Up

Since this session is only 90 minutes we will move pretty quickly through the examples.  To get started you will need to have a laptop with Cordova installed.  If you will be developing for IOS you will need to have a Mac,  if you are developing for Android you can use almost any modern laptop and OS.  **There will not be time for you to set up your development environment during this session,  you will need to have it set up ahead of time to participate in it.**

Other things you will need to have:

* Cordova needs to be installed on your machine.  You can find instructions [here](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/#installing-the-cordova-cli).
* If you are develping for Android you will need to have the Android SDK (we also recommend installing Android Studio to take advantage of the development tools).  You can find instruction on installing it [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html).
* If you are develpoing for IOS you will need to have X-Code installed and have things set up to be able to deploy a test app to your I-Phone.
* All pre-requisite environment settings etc. so that Cordova can complile and run applications for your target platform.  You can find instructions [here](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/#install-pre-requisites-for-building)

##Getting Your Project Set Up
